# Number storage optimization
Firsts digits which are common to the numbers should not be duplicated in the memory. Fortunately, the specifications also have this little chart to guide you in the implementation :
```
0_4_1_2_5_7_8_4_4_0 Bill Jobs
  |   |_1_9_9_8_0_3 J.P Ravidole
  |_6_8_8_9_2_0_1_1 R. Robichet
1_1_2 Urgences
|_1_5 S.A.M.U.
```
